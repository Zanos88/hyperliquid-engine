# btc-signal-bot — Stage 2 (Signal + dry-run-gated execution)

BTC-PERP multi-timeframe confluence signal bot for a Propr.xyz 1-Step
Classic challenge account. It posts Telegram alerts and (Stage 2) can
drive a Propr execution layer — but **order dispatch is OFF by default,
behind a two-switch safety gate**: a real order is sent only when BOTH
`DRY_RUN=false` (env) AND `feature_flags.execution_enabled: true`
(`config.yaml`) are set. With either switch in its default position the
engine is in dry-run — order intents are recorded and logged, never sent
(`execution/propr_client.py`, wrapping the vendored SDK in
`execution/vendor/propr_sdk.py`).

> **Note:** there is no `execution/propr_stub.py`. That original Stage 1
> stub (which raised `NotImplementedError`) has been replaced by the
> dry-run-gated `execution/propr_client.py`; the safety guarantee is now
> the two-switch gate, not the absence of an order path. Older docs that
> still reference `propr_stub.py` predate this change.

Deployed live to Railway as a worker — see "Live deployment" below. The
pytest suite is the acceptance contract (see [Tests](#tests)).

Built from [`btc-signal-bot-build-spec.md`](btc-signal-bot-build-spec.md).
See [`docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md`](docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md) for every
cited source behind the API/indicator choices (Fisher period 10 per
Ehlers' primary paper, OBV + 20-SMA confirmation, Hyperliquid
candleSnapshot feed), and
[`docs/STRATEGY_PSEUDOCODE.md`](docs/STRATEGY_PSEUDOCODE.md) for the
decision tree the code implements.

**This strategy is live and unvalidated — no backtest exists.** Parameters
were chosen conservatively (cited defaults where they exist) but there is
no historical performance evidence behind them. Treat every alert as an
untested hypothesis, not a proven edge.

This repo is **completely separate** from the existing Bullphoric
(ALON/TROLL/ANSEM) Telegram bot: separate Git repo, separate Telegram bot
token/channel (`BTC_SIGNAL_BOT_TELEGRAM_*` env vars), no shared code,
config, or Supabase tables.

## Strategy summary

- **4H bias** (`strategy/bias_4h.py`): fractal swing detection →
  Fibonacci retracement/extension + horizontal S/R → BULLISH / BEARISH /
  NEUTRAL.
- **1H trigger** (`strategy/trigger_1h.py`): Fisher Transform (period 10,
  Ehlers' primary-source default — supersedes the platform-convention 9)
  cross + OBV-vs-its-own-20-SMA confirmation, evaluated only on closed 1H
  candles.
- **Confluence gate** (`strategy/signals.py`): a signal only exists when
  the 1H trigger direction matches the 4H bias. Stop is structural
  (beyond the relevant S/R/swing), target is the next opposing structural
  level, and any signal with R:R < 2:1 is suppressed and logged, not
  alerted.
- **Sizing** (`risk/sizing.py`): 0.75% equity risk per trade by default,
  truncated down to Hyperliquid's BTC quantity step.
- **Circuit breaker** (`risk/circuit_breaker.py`): halts new signals at
  −2.5% daily P&L (a deliberate buffer inside Propr's real 3% daily
  limit), resumes automatically at 00:00 UTC.
- **Ledger** (`ledger/tracker.py`): tracks the bot's own hypothetical
  open/closed positions so the Telegram channel is a complete auditable
  record, and so the circuit breaker has a real equity curve to gate on.

## Repository layout

```
config.yaml            # account params, risk %, telegram, feature flags
strategy/               # bias_4h.py, trigger_1h.py, signals.py — zero imports from alerts/ or execution/
data/feed.py            # Hyperliquid public OHLCV fetch
risk/                   # sizing.py, circuit_breaker.py, gate.py, challenge.py
alerts/                 # telegram.py, formats.py
execution/              # propr_client.py (dry-run-gated Propr client) + vendor/propr_sdk.py
db/                     # store.py (Postgres telemetry + live settings), schema.sql
ledger/tracker.py       # hypothetical positions + daily P&L
main.py                 # Stage 2 scheduler loop (candle-close driven)
tests/                  # pytest unit tests against synthetic data
```

`strategy/`, `risk/`, and `ledger/` have zero imports from `alerts/` or
`execution/` — signals are plain data objects. This is what lets Stage 2
bolt an execution layer on without touching strategy code.

## Live deployment (Railway)

Deployed 2026-07-07 as a Railway **worker** (see `Procfile`) in its own
project — completely separate from Bullphoric's Railway service:

- Project/service: `btc-signal-bot` (workspace: zanos88's Projects)
- Env vars (service-scoped, isolated): `BTC_SIGNAL_BOT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN`,
  `BTC_SIGNAL_BOT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (note: channel IDs need the `-100`
  prefix — `-1004401790873`, not the bare ID BotFather-adjacent tools show)
- Bot: @Tradingdeskincbot → channel "TradingDesk Inc (Propr)"
- On boot the bot sends a startup heartbeat immediately, so a successful
  deploy is visible in the channel within seconds

Operate it with the Railway CLI from this directory:

```bash
railway logs --service btc-signal-bot    # read live logs ("alive:" lines = healthy)
railway up --service btc-signal-bot --detach   # redeploy after changes
# stop/restart/scale: Railway dashboard -> project btc-signal-bot
```

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in BTC_SIGNAL_BOT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN / _CHAT_ID
export $(cat .env | xargs)   # or use your process manager's env loading
python main.py
```

The bot polls every 60 seconds but only evaluates strategy logic when a
new trigger-timeframe candle has closed — detected data-drivenly via
`last_trigger_open_seen` / `newest_closed_open_time` in `main.py` (robust
for any native interval, no epoch-boundary assumptions). Logs go to
stdout (`logging.basicConfig`); redirect to a file or your platform's log
capture as needed.

### Stopping

`Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) or send SIGTERM to the process — there is no persisted
state beyond the in-memory `Ledger`/`CircuitBreaker` objects for Stage 1,
so a restart begins a fresh day/equity curve from `config.yaml`'s
`starting_equity_usd`. This is a known Stage 1 limitation (see Open Items).

### Configuring

Edit `config.yaml` for account size, the sizing `risk_pct` default, fixed
indicator periods, R:R minimum, and heartbeat interval. **Note:** the
running engine reads active timeframes, indicator toggles, live risk
params, and signal geometry from Postgres (`strategy_settings`,
`indicator_config`, `risk_params` — set via the Telegram `/settings`
menu), *not* from `config.yaml`; the `data:` block in `config.yaml`
documents the seed only (the engine does not read it). **Never lower
`risk.circuit_breaker_halt_pct` below −2.5%** (build spec section 6/11 —
it's a hard-coded constant in `risk/circuit_breaker.py`, not read from
config, specifically so it can't be casually widened).

### Reading logs / alerts

- Console/stdout: `INFO` level per-loop status, `WARNING` on feed or
  Telegram-send failures (never a silent `except: pass`).
- Telegram channel: four alert types — entry signal, exit (stop/target),
  daily summary (00:00 UTC), heartbeat (every 4h — silence means the
  process is dead).

## Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

The suite is **240 tests across 29 files** (229 passing, 11 skipped in a
default environment) covering the strategy, risk, ledger, alerts,
execution-client and data layers against synthetic data (no live API
calls). The 11 skips are the DB-backed suites that need
`TEST_DATABASE_URL` (`tests/test_db_trigger.py`,
`tests/test_forward_report.py` — see below) plus the web-dashboard tests
that need the optional `web/requirements.txt` deps. These are the
acceptance contract: if a change breaks one, fix the module, not the
test.

### DB trigger tests (staging Supabase only)

`tests/test_db_trigger.py` needs a real Postgres and is **skipped** by the
command above. It runs ONLY against the staging project
`btc-signal-bot-staging`, via `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (the staging session-pooler
URI) — it never reads `DATABASE_URL` and never touches the live engine's DB:

```powershell
$env:TEST_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://postgres.<ref>:<pw>@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres"
python -m pytest tests/test_db_trigger.py -v   # 7 passed
```

See `docs/V2_RUNBOOK.md` → "Running the DB tests" for the rationale (the
2026-07-08 live-engine-paused incident) and the live-ref guard.

## Stage 2 integration notes (execution layer — partially built)

The Propr execution layer now exists as `execution/propr_client.py`
(dry-run-gated) wrapping the vendored SDK, and `main.py` already wires the
entry-signal branch to `create_entry_with_bracket(...)` on an ACTIVE
engine state — all behind the two-switch dry-run gate. Strategy code was
not touched (module firewall preserved). Remaining work to go fully live:

1. **Resolve the account-equity endpoint gap first** — no confirmed Propr
   endpoint returns live total equity (see Open Items below). `main.py`
   currently derives "equity" purely from the hypothetical ledger; going
   live must decide whether to trust Propr's real equity or keep
   paper-tracking in parallel for reconciliation.
2. Feed live Propr position/fill data into `ledger/tracker.py` in place of
   the price-touch simulation, so exits reflect real fills, not idealized
   stop/target execution.
3. Add reconciliation logging comparing Propr's reported equity against
   the ledger's tracked equity — any divergence should be a WARNING per
   this project's no-silent-fallback rule.
4. Harden the order-dispatch error paths before flipping either switch —
   see the code-health notes (`create_entry_with_bracket`/`kill_sequence`
   have no per-item retry/rollback today).

## Open Items / Needs Manual Confirmation

Full detail in `docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md`. Consolidated:

1. **Propr account/equity endpoint** — not found in public docs. Blocks
   Stage 2's equity-based sizing/circuit-breaker wiring against the real
   account; does not block Stage 1.
2. **Propr WebSocket schema** — mentioned but undocumented. Only matters
   for Stage 2 push-based position updates.
3. **OBV moving-average window (currently 20)** — this repo's own
   reasonable default, not sourced from a citation. Revisit after any
   forward-testing period.
4. **Hyperliquid `/info` public rate limit** — not explicitly published.
   Current candle-close-driven polling cadence is conservative but
   unverified against a hard number.
5. **No persisted state across restarts** — Stage 1's `Ledger` and
   `CircuitBreaker` are in-memory only. A process restart mid-day resets
   the daily P&L baseline. Acceptable for a Stage 1 pilot; Stage 2 (or an
   earlier Stage 1 hardening pass) should persist ledger state (e.g. to a
   local SQLite file) if extended unattended uptime is required.

## Risk & scope reminders

- Execution is dry-run by default (two-switch gate — see the top of this
  README). No performance claims are made or implied anywhere in this repo.
- Prohibited by the Propr challenge terms and not present here: HFT,
  martingale, or grid logic.
- All strategy decisions evaluate on closed candles only (no
  intra-candle/repainting signals).
